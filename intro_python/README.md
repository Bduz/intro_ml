Some resources for learning python

* [Introduction To Computer Science And Programming In Python at **MIT**](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/)
  
  6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python is intended for students with little or no programming experience. It aims to provide students 
  with an understanding of the role computation can play in solving problems and to help students, regardless of their major, feel justifiably confident of their 
  ability to write small programs that allow them to accomplish useful goals.

* [The Python Tutorial at **python.org**](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)

  This tutorial does not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every single feature, or even every commonly used feature. Instead, it introduces many of Python’s 
  most noteworthy features, and will give you a good idea of the language’s flavor and style. After reading it, you will be able to read and write Python modules and 
  programs, and you will be ready to learn more about the various Python library modules described in The Python Standard Library.

* [Interactive Python tutorial at **learnpython.org**](https://www.learnpython.org)

  Whether you are an experienced programmer or not, this website is intended for everyone who wishes to learn the Python programming language. After you complete the tutorials, you can get certified at LearnX and add your certification to your LinkedIn profile.

* [Introduction to Statistical Learning with applications in Python at **statlearning.com**](https://intro-stat-learning.github.io/ISLP)

  This is actually not a python tutorial. It is the accompanying pyhton library for the [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/) 
  book. This book provides a broad and less technical treatment of key topics in statistical learning. It is appropriate for anyone who wishes to use 
  contemporary tools for data analysis. After each chapter, there is a lab covering its topic. The notebooks are well-written and easy-to-use.
  
* [Introduction to Programming with Python at **Harvard**](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50s-introduction-programming-python)

  An introduction to programming using a language called Python. Learn how to read and write code as well as how to test and "debug" it. Designed for students with 
  and without prior programming experience who'd like to learn Python specifically. Learn about functions; variables and 
  types; conditions and Boolean expressions; loops; and objects and methods. Plus exceptions, file I/O, and libraries. Hands-on opportunities for lots of practice. 
  Exercises inspired by real-world programming problems. The full video of the entire course is on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRL_NcnK-4).
