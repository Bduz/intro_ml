Some resources for learning python

* [Introduction To Computer Science And Programming In Python at **MIT**](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/)
  
  6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python is intended for students with little or no programming experience. It aims to provide students 
  with an understanding of the role computation can play in solving problems and to help students, regardless of their major, feel justifiably confident of their 
  ability to write small programs that allow them to accomplish useful goals.

* [The Python Tutorial at **python.org**](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)

  This tutorial does not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every single feature, or even every commonly used feature. Instead, it introduces many of Python’s 
  most noteworthy features, and will give you a good idea of the language’s flavor and style. After reading it, you will be able to read and write Python modules and 
  programs, and you will be ready to learn more about the various Python library modules described in The Python Standard Library.

* [Interactive Python tutorial at **learnpython.org**](https://www.learnpython.org)

  Whether you are an experienced programmer or not, this website is intended for everyone who wishes to learn the Python programming language. After you complete the 
  tutorials, you can get certified at LearnX and add your certification to your LinkedIn profile.
